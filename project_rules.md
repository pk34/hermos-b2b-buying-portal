## Summary Notes

- Updated the quote item card label and value typography to render inline so the layout no longer depends on the TypeScript-incompatible component prop while preserving the requested styling.
- Coerced formatted date values to strings before rendering so Typography always receives valid children and the build errors are resolved.
